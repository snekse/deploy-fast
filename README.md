# deploy-fast

## Project description

We investigated various methods of deploying code quickly without a lot of setup
and infrastructure.  The directories in this repo are meant to be self contained
projects.  Each one has a readme.md and optional code showing the steps to perform 
these 3 actions:

- Sign up for an account
- Deploy some code
- Tear everything back down


## Future improvements 

- Add more service providers
- Create both a real world and hello world examples for each provider
- Time each solution and create a table
- Gather costs for each solution and create a table

## Pull requests welcome

Please feel free to submit a pull request.  Try to follow the general pattern in the 
existing readme.md files.


## Disclaimer

None of these examples are meant to be run in a production environment.  These are
simple examples meant for non-critical and non-secure data.
